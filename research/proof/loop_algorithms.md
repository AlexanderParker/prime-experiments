# Loop: algorithms that carry residues by mirrors to an open flip in the window

Owner, 2026-09-15: the mirror action is the only provable way to bring residues along the number
line; construct an algorithm that picks up all the required residues along a walk to guarantee
an open flip in the window; define algorithms around these principles until one finds a twin in
the window without secret knowledge about the opening.

Rules of the loop: every algorithm is stated in the machine's terms (origin, mirrors, periods,
directions); what information it uses is stated; it is run at every machine 11 to 2000 at least;
the result is the count of machines where it lands on a twin inside the window, with where it
fails; no counting arguments; one entry per algorithm, kept whether it works or not.

Standing facts the algorithms must respect (proved):
- A walk from home on mirrors M_1, M_2, ... lands at -1 + 2 (integer combination of the M_i), so
  the landing is -1 modulo the gcd of the mirrors: residue -1 is carried exactly for the gears
  dividing every mirror. To land in the window the gcd must be at most q^2 / 2.
- A gear's phase at a column is the column mod the gear; it strikes the slot when the phase is 0
  or gear - 2; a step about a mirror holding the gear moves its phase by 0, any other step by
  the mirror size mod the gear, with the step's sign.

### 1. The pick-up walk, greedy (2026-09-15)

Visit the gears above the base in order; at gear g the mirror is {base, g}; choose the first
(periods k in 1..K, direction) such that every gear visited so far, g itself and the base are
off their teeth at the new column, and the column stays in [0, q^2]. Uses the walk's own phases,
no primality. research/stack/r8/pickup_walk.py, results_pickup_walk.txt, machines 11 to 2000.
- Descending from q: K = 1 stuck at all 299; K = 2 twin at 2, stuck 297; K = 3 twin 3; K = 5 twin
  10, stuck 289 (q = 31 reaches 227). Stuck typically at a gear in the middle (101: at 37; 499:
  at 281; 1999: at 281 or 1373).
- Ascending from the first gear above the base: stuck at all 299 for every K, at 7, 11, 13, 17
  or 23: the small gears leave few open phases and each step offers only 2K columns.
Verdict: greedy with 2K choices per step cannot hold every visited gear off its teeth; the
constraint tightens by one gear per step while the choices stay at 2K.
