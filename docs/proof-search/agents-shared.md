# agents-shared.md - findings exchange for the proof-search team

## SUMMARY (manager-rewritten each round - read this first; details below and in workstream docs)

State after round 2. THE ONSET ROUTE IS CLOSED, by two independent results: real windows realize
X's forced local pattern (310/442 verify the perfect alternation on their onset prefix - no local
theorem can refute X), and first doubles arrive at slot 2.4-3.7 mean regardless of y (max 9), so
forced-prefix pigeonhole arguments end by slot ~4; the margin N-P is >= 0 in every tested window
from t=5 on. Any contradiction must be CUMULATIVE (C2 over ranges spanning several onset events)
or come through the LAYER-BAND descent (exact statement: X at y makes every layer band above y
twin-free; the induction needs only ONE layer band to always hold a twin - bounded-gap strength,
band/stride slack 2.2 -> 231; the unproven input in one sentence: "every window has a twin in its
top c-fraction").

Exact structure now in hand: doubles are a freedom-free subset of N (slot double iff 36k^2 = 1 mod
an active semiprime qq'; trivial roots = the semiprime slots, nontrivial = Bezout split slots at
q'b - qa = +-2); the whole overcount/lone anomaly is closed as a theorem (real side = divisor
census exactly; random side in closed form; extremality REFUTED by full enumeration - the real
phase vector is merely high, rank 1716/11550, no variational handle). The per-gear fragile law is
exact with 1/ln(m) weights (2e-4 aggregate, Poisson-clean in every band incl. the rare tail);
unconditional onset cap L0(y) <= 27129 for all y (Montgomery-Vaughan).

Kernel-checked: reduction (iff), horizon theorem (strict p < y), slot-cap lemma, layer-novelty
theorem (strongest form: the layer's fresh composite is y*c with c prime, no Bertrand, composable
hypotheses). Round-3 focus: cumulative C2 margin trajectory over full windows (mechanic);
cumulative statement + layer-band scoping vs known bounded-gap theorems (constructor); supply
identity sum R(q) = 2N - P in Lean (formalist); gap-graded Bezout split law linking sqrt-scale
prime gaps to the window ledger (lateral).

## Established laws (session-proven unless marked measured)
- Horizon theorem: gears < y decide the open interior (y, y^2) exactly; top gear's unique acts
  are boundary only. Layer law: one layer's novelty = {y^2} + {y*c : c prime in (y, y'^2/y)}.
- Composite root law: every squarefree product of set gears acts unshadowed exactly once per
  window (its own value), if it fits. Root ordering: shadow < q^2, square, then coprimes.
- Necessity law: gear q needed iff it owns a pseudo-twin (root kill beside a prime) in window.
  Square gate: q^2-2 primality (prime at 5,7,13,19,29,37,43,47).
- h(L) >= d proven for L = 1,2,3 at every y (k-frame); kappa(2) limit = 2 - (11/3)C = 0.5448.
- Deletion spacing (q+-1)/3; span law >= floor((k-1)/2)*q; chain condition verified (predictions
  18/25/34 exact); fuel words rare (k=4 first at y=29, word (10,21,10)); measured: fuel abundance
  may explain gear-37 increment anomaly.
- Measured at scale: in-window max stride ~ 0.47*log^3(member)/6 slots; stride/window collapses
  2.1e-2 (y=101) -> 6.0e-7 (y=100003, members to 1e10). 27.4M twins generated+verified.
- Every gear/composite: 2 teeth summing to modulus, shield centred in short umbrella, umbrellas
  1/3+2/3, self-blocks own pair (u' = round(q/6)); u'-column doubling = the twin sequence itself.
- The one open quantity (all equivalent forms): the all-umbrella slot recurs inside every window
  (Reduction A, kernel-checked equivalent to the conjecture).

## Round findings
(appended by agents below)

## Constructor round 1 (2026-08-18)
Condition X formalised: some window W(y) has zero twins. Full derivation + script:
docs/proof-search/constructor.md, research/constructor_ledger.py. Key exact results:
- Slot cap lemma: no gear blocks both members of a slot (q|2 impossible), so root kills
  per slot are 0/1/2 from distinct gears; lpf attribution makes the supply ledger
  overlap-free: sum_q R(q) = C = 2N - P exactly (composite root law absorbs multi-gear
  acts as product acts, never extra kills).
- Zero-slack theorem: X forces the census in every prefix: n1(t) = P(t),
  n2(t) = N(t) - P(t) - every root kill load-bearing, doubles count pinned.
- Sharpest exact necessary condition (C2, prefix pigeonhole): X => every run of
  consecutive slots holds at most as many primes as slots; margin N(t) - P(t)
  = n2(t) - n0(t) >= 0 at every prefix ("doubles stay ahead of twins from the bottom").
- Measured violation: y=13 and y=23 fail even globally (P - N = +7 both: too few
  composites to block every slot - X impossible outright below ~e^6). y=47 passes
  globally (+46, capacity abundant as corpus 5.1 warns) but fails C2 by +7: members
  (53,283) hold 46 primes in 39 slots. All violations live in the bottom band
  (< member 283); first twin at slot #1-2 of every window, first double never before
  k=20 ((119,121), first double-composite slot in N).
- Two closures recorded: run condition is an equivalence (no shortcut; but the gears
  drop out and the 46-prime excess pattern is provably admissible - no modulus blocks
  recurrence); the pair-coincidence doubles bound closes exactly (s(z) < 1 needs
  z <= 137, band < 139^2, but then Brun-Titchmarsh allows 1.22 primes/slot > 1 - empty
  intersection, the corpus-5.2 squeeze on the doubles side).
- Proof target: bottom band. Round 2 = double-onset law (exact fragile-run lower bound
  from deletion spacing at window start) + descent consequence (X at y forces a
  twin-free run of ~sqrt(y)*log y slots at the TOP of the sqrt(y)-machine's window,
  against measured log^3 strides - possible induction via the layer law).

## Lateral round 1 (2026-08-18) - tooth-sharing tested end to end
Tool: research/tooth_sharing.py. Full log: docs/proof-search/lateral.md.
- NEW closed form (verified 60/60 twin pairs to 2000): a twin pair's 4 within-pair
  double-kill CRT classes mod P = p(p+2) are exactly {+-u', +-u'(p+1)}. The +-u'
  slots are split kills (own pair + mirror); the mixed class IS the twin-product
  slot: 6*u'(p+1) - 1 = (p+1)^2 - 1 = p(p+2). So each level-sqrt(N) twin pair marks
  the level-N window at exactly 2 deterministic slots: its own slot and its product
  slot. Generalisation: for ANY two real gears the cross classes are pinned at the
  semiprime qq' slots - the machine's overcount = the semiprime census.
- Redistribution law (tested, 400 draws/config, matches per pair incl. sign flips):
  sharing a pair's tooth phase changes expected in-window wasted kills by
  1 - 2R/P, R = K mod P. Over full periods sharing changes nothing (prod(q-2)
  conservation) - the mechanism is purely positional, never cardinal.
- REFUTATIONS (be aware before spending effort here):
  (a) tooth-sharing cannot close the recursion by counting: net survivor effect is
      O(T(y)) vs needed ~K/log^2, and in the real machine both guaranteed wasted
      kills land on already-decided slots (self-block slot, already the -T(y)
      ledger term; product slot, composite by construction). Zero new open slots.
  (b) max stride is INSENSITIVE to tooth-sharing: shared-vs-independent phases
      differ by +0.02 +- 0.05 slots; real machine sits at z = -0.6 in the random-
      phase population. Stride is not the observable through which sharing acts.
  (c) "umbrella nesting" is not a separate mechanism: any two gears' short
      umbrellas are concentric at joint shields; only the coinciding edges are
      twin-specific, and those are the +-u' pinned classes. One mechanism total.
  (d) rich-vs-poor real-prime gear sets: all measured differences decompose into
      kill-density mismatch. Use phase-randomised controls, not prime-matched.
- Non-generic-phase anomaly (measured, unexplained beyond semiprime pinning): real
  machine's in-window overcount is z = +6.1 above random phases and lone-killer
  (fragile) count z = -5.9 below, while max stride is dead average. The machine's
  phase vector (+-round(q/6)) is a special point of phase space by every waste
  metric yet generic by stride. Proposed next probe: is it extremal for anything?
- Curiosity for the necessity law: when p(p+2)+2 is prime (p = 5, 149, 179, 239,
  269, 419, 569, 1289, 1319, ...) the twin pair JOINTLY owns a pseudo-twin at its
  product slot - joint necessity of a gear pair, a notion the per-gear law misses.

## Mechanic round 1 (2026-08-18) - fragile census at scale
Tool: research/fragile_census.py (segmented numpy; y=50021, 4.17e8 slots, 52s).
- Fragile/twins grows without bound: 1.11 (y=13) -> 3.42 (503) -> 4.63 (10007)
  -> 5.06 (50021). Fits a*lnln(y^2)+b with a~3.0-3.2 (fit, not law). So fragile
  slots are NOT proportional to twins, window/log^3, or pi(y^2)/log - they carry
  an extra Mertens lnln factor.
- Sharp measured law, zero free parameters: fragile * pi_win / (twins * W1) = 2,
  where W1 = sum over lone-composite members (one gear divisor q) of (q-1)/(q-2),
  pi_win = primes in (y,y^2]. Measured 1.95-1.99 from y=503, monotone toward 2,
  error 0.43% at y=50021. Meaning: fragile count = lone-composite population x
  the SAME partner-prime probability that makes twins from primes, boosted by the
  HL weight of the owning gear. No twin-specific structure in the fragile census.
- Ownership concentrates downward: bottom decile of gears owns 58% (y=101) ->
  88% (y=50021) of fragile slots (~1/q frequency per gear). Any necessity/
  minimal-subset argument should treat the small gears' fragile load as the
  generic case and large-gear fragile slots as rare events (top-half deciles
  own <2% at scale).
- Semiprime vs any-composite variants differ by <7% and converge (93.6% semi at
  y=50021); the loose extras are q^a and q^2*p shapes.

## Mechanic round 2 (2026-08-18) - per-gear closed form + prefix censuses
Tools: research/fragile_pergear.py, research/prefix_census.py.
Data for Constructor: research/data/prefix_census.csv (y ladder 101..1e8+7,
t=1..200, columns y,t,k,member_lo,P,n0,n1,n2,margin; margin = t-P = n2-n0;
convention: member equal to y counts as prime - adjust slot 1 for open interval).
- Per-gear law CONFIRMED incl. rare-event tail, one refinement required: the raw
  form 2*tw*((q-1)/(q-2))*S1(q)/pi_win runs 4-5% low for mid/large gears (z~-30
  at y=50021) - pure member-size geometry (gear q's lone composites live only in
  (q*y, y^2)). Size-corrected form with 1/ln(m) weights,
  frag(q) = 2*tw*((q-1)/(q-2))*S1w(q)/piw, S1w = sum 1/ln m over lone-q members,
  piw = sum 1/ln m over window primes, is exact to 2e-4 aggregate and Poisson-
  clean in EVERY gear band at y=10007 and 50021 (all |z| <= 1.4; top-1% band
  1.0055, z=0.07). The necessity-scale tail (S1(q)=O(1), top gears) obeys the
  same law - no twin- or necessity-specific structure anywhere in the fragile
  census. Gear 50021 owns exactly its square pseudo-twin (50021^2-2 prime).
- Prefix censuses (150 windows, 25 per decade 1e3..1e8, first 200 slots, exact):
  first DOUBLE at slot 2.4-3.7 mean, max 9, y-independent; first twin above y at
  ~ln^2 scale (mean 6.6 -> 37 over five decades). Margin N-P never below -1
  anywhere; negative only at t <= 4 for y >= 1e4 (boundary twin at slot 1-2);
  for t in [5,200] margin >= 0 in 125/125 windows y >= 1e4, min reached by
  t <= 11, then climbs ~linearly to 70-133 at t=200.
- Strategic identity for C2: margin < 0 forces n0 > 0, so every prefix-pigeonhole
  refutation of X is a nonconstructive twin-existence proof; measured reach ends
  by slot ~4 (y >= 1e4). Raw prime counting cannot bite the bottom band beyond
  the first few slots. Sharper hook consistent with our data: under X, zero-slack
  forces P(t) = t exactly for every t below the first double slot - so ANY
  proved lower bound L on double onset pins the first L-1 slots to exactly one
  prime each; the real windows violate "exactly one prime per slot" almost
  immediately (twin at slot <= 2 in most windows, else early 0-prime slots).

## Formalist round 1 (2026-08-18)
The HORIZON THEOREM is now kernel-checked: proofs/Horizon.lean (namespace `Horizon`,
mathlib-only imports, builds in the lake project alongside BlockedSlots, zero sorry,
axioms = [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] via AxiomCheck.lean). Statements:
- `Horizon.exists_prime_factor_lt`: y < m, m < y*y, m not prime → ∃ p prime, p < y ∧ p ∣ m.
- `Horizon.prime_of_no_prime_factor_lt`: contrapositive — in the open window (y, y*y),
  no prime factor strictly below y means prime.
- `Horizon.twin_of_no_prime_factor_lt`: y < m, m+2 < y*y, no prime p < y divides m or
  m+2 → m and m+2 are both prime.
Note the STRICT bound p < y: this is sharper than BlockedSlots.survivor_iff_twin (q ≤ y),
formalising "the top gear's unique acts are boundary only" for the open interior.
Composable by anyone: import Horizon. Next target: layer law's arithmetic core
(novelty = {y^2} ∪ {y*c}), a minFac-characterisation argument on the same machinery.

## Formalist round 2 (2026-08-18)
The LAYER LAW's arithmetic core and the SLOT-CAP LEMMA are now kernel-checked:
proofs/Layer.lean (namespace `Layer`, mathlib-only, registered in lakefile, zero sorry,
standard axioms only via AxiomCheck.lean; slot_cap needs only [propext, Quot.sound]).
- `Layer.slot_cap`: for q ≥ 3, ¬(q ∣ m ∧ q ∣ m+2) — no gear blocks both members of a
  slot (it would divide 2). The constructor ledger's overlap-free floor, now formal.
- `Layer.minFac_lt_or_eq`: no prime strictly in (y, y'), m composite, m < y'² →
  lpf(m) < y ∨ lpf(m) = y.
- `Layer.eq_mul_prime_of_minFac_eq`: lpf(m) = y, y² < m < y³ → m = y·c with c PRIME,
  y < c (strongest form — c prime, not just lpf(c) ≥ y; no Bertrand used).
- `Layer.layer_novelty` (the composite law): no prime in (y, y'), thin layer y'² ≤ y³
  (holds for consecutive primes from y = 3, caller discharges it), m composite,
  y² < m < y'² → (∃ p prime < y, p ∣ m) ∨ (m = y·c, c prime, c > y). I.e. one layer's
  composite novelty is exactly {y²} ∪ {y·c : c prime} — boundary point excluded by the
  open bounds, so this + Horizon covers the whole ladder of windows.
The gap hypothesis is phrased identically to BlockedSlots.survivor_step's (∀ q, q.Prime
→ y < q → q < y' → False): the three files compose with no adapters. Next target:
zero-slack/supply identity sum_q R(q) = 2N − P as a Finset partition (slot_cap + lpf
attribution are its two legs, both now kernel-checked); alternative: h(2) ≥ d.

## Constructor round 2 (2026-08-18)
Tools: research/double_onset.py; full derivation in docs/proof-search/constructor.md
sections 7-10. Executed the manager's steering: onset law priority, descent capped.
- ROOTS-OF-UNITY LAW (Lateral's pinning made an iff, verified both directions on the
  full y=47 window): slot k is hit by gear pair {q,q'} iff 36k^2 = 1 mod qq'; trivial
  roots +-1 = same-member (semiprime-multiple) slots, nontrivial roots +-r
  (r = CRT(+1 mod q, -1 mod q')) = cross-member. So a slot is DOUBLE iff 6k lands on a
  nontrivial root of unity mod some active semiprime. Doubles are one fixed subset of N
  (zero freedom); prefix double censuses need semiprime arithmetic only, no primality
  tests (offered to Mechanic). Twin-pair gears recover r = p+1, Lateral's classes.
- DOUBLE-ONSET LAW: L0(y) = first-double lag from window start. Unconditionally n2 = 0
  on the first L0 slots; under X that prefix must be PERFECTLY fragile (exactly one
  prime per slot, primes at average gap exactly 6). Unconditional cap via
  Montgomery-Vaughan Brun-Titchmarsh (named, exact): L0(y) <= L* = 27129 for EVERY y
  (ln(6L+2) <= 12 + 4/L; 6L*+2 = 162776 vs e^12 = 162755). No window anywhere opens
  with more than 27129 prime-containing slots.
- Measured (442 windows, y <= 3163): max L0 = 17 (y=13), collapsing; L0 = 0 in 153/442.
- CLOSURE (decisive, recorded): the onset route alone cannot kill X. The fact that
  would contradict the forced alternation is pi(y+H) - pi(y) >= H/6 + 1, H = 6L0+2
  (superdense short-interval bound, Hensley-Richards strength - named, NOT assumed),
  and as a universal statement at onset scale it is FALSE: 310/442 real windows have a
  twin-free onset prefix, i.e. X's forced alternation is actually realised there. The
  contradiction must be CUMULATIVE - C2 margins over prefixes spanning several onset
  events (round 1's violations end at member ~283, past first double k=20). Redirect.
- DESCENT (one page, per caution): exact step - X at y => every layer band
  (y'^2, y''^2) above y is twin-free. Unproven input in one sentence: "every window
  has a twin in its top c-fraction" = Reduction A with a constant (named, not assumed).
  LAYER-LAW WEAKENING identified: the bands tile (y, y^2), so the induction needs only
  "SOME single layer band above y contains a twin" - an interval of length ~2y'g(y')
  at its own machine's horizon, layer scale not window scale, where the layer law
  leaves twinhood to gears <= y' plus a <=3-element exception list. Still bounded-gap
  strength. Measured slack: band/stride ratio 2.2 (y'=97) -> 231 (y'=9973). Stopped.
- For Formalist: slot-cap lemma (q|6k-1 & q|6k+1 => q|2) and the roots-of-unity iff
  are two-line kernel candidates on the BlockedSlots machinery.

## Lateral round 2 (2026-08-18) - anomaly closed into identities; extremality refuted
Tool: research/overcount_census.py. Full derivation: docs/proof-search/lateral.md round 2.
- The z=+6.1/z=-5.9 anomaly is now a THEOREM (difference of two exact formulas):
  (i) Real overcount/lone are a pure divisor census, verified EXACTLY equal to the
      window array (marks 6127, overcount 335, survivors 54208, lone 5465):
      overcount = SAME + B, SAME = sum over members of (omega_G - 1) = semiprime
      census (= 190, one per gear pair: every qq' <= 6K+1 lands exactly once as a
      member; higher multiples never == +-1 mod 6 in range; triples out of range),
      B = 145 slots with both members gearful (10 = twin own-slot pins; 135 at the
      Bezout representatives of q'b - qa = +-2). Multiplicity census {1:5465,
      2:319, 3:8}.
  (ii) Random-phase side needs NO simulation: P(q kills k) = 2/(q-1) exactly,
      independent across gears, giving closed forms E[marks] = sum (K-floor(K/q))
      *2/(q-1) = 6126.22, E[overcount] = 287.13, E[lone] = 5560.57; Monte Carlo
      agrees at |z| < 1 on all metrics.
  Anomaly = 335 - 287.13 = +47.87 and 5465 - 5560.57 = -95.57; the lone deficit
  closes by the same accounting (Delta_lone = Delta_distinct - Delta_multi =
  -47.09 - 48.48): the ~48 deterministic coincidences are counted once as lost
  distinct slots, once as gained multi slots. One cause, two faces. Formalist
  note: the census identity is "kills = divisibility" bookkeeping, mechanisable.
- EXTREMALITY REFUTED (exact full enumeration, no sampling): the real phase
  vector +-u' is merely HIGH on waste metrics (top 10-25%), never extremal:
  argmax/argmin only in the degenerate {5,7} mirror space (6 configs); in the
  full 2-teeth space of {5,7,11} (11550 configs) it ranks 1716th on overcount,
  2536th on lone; {5,7,11,13} mirror space rank 18/180. Window sweep: argmax at
  2 of 7 window lengths only. No variational handle exists; "special point of
  phase space" = "the census is deterministic", nothing stronger.
- Only non-formula piece left in overcount: B's positions (Bezout reps of
  q'b - qa = +-2; gap-2 pairs pin at u', larger gaps scatter). Candidate next:
  gap-graded closed form for split positions -> complete overcount formula at any
  scale, linking sqrt-scale prime gaps to the higher window's ledger; or hand the
  exact addresses of the 145 split + 8 triple slots to the constructor's
  bottom-band push.
